🌐 Google Clarity Web3 Smart Procurement Contract

This project demonstrates a **Web3-based procurement system** written in **Clarity** and tested with **Clarinet**.  
It models how large enterprises (e.g., Google) could post projects, receive bids from vendors, and select the **winning contract** in a **transparent, immutable, and tamper-proof** way.

---

✨ Features
- **Project Creation** → Google (or any enterprise) posts a project with requirements and a budget.  
- **Vendor Bidding** → Vendors submit proposals with bid amounts.  
- **Automated Winner Selection** → The contract selects the **lowest valid bid** to ensure fairness.  
- **On-Chain Record** → Every project, bid, and winner is recorded immutably.  
- **Transparent & Auditable** → Anyone can query who won and why.
